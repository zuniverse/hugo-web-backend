Requiem for an Self Portrait. Poster of 170x120 cm. Digital image made of accumulation of more than 130 drawings with the bic. The work of fragmentation of the body imposes itself in this immense self-portrait, in a wink, to the self-analysis of our time. Questioning the issues of self-portraiture in art at the time of the total and totalitarian popularization of the selfie. The bus shelter format of the poster is a reminder of the mercantile exploitation of the image of the human body.
