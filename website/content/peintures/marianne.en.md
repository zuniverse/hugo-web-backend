Marianne, oil, acrylic on canvas, 130x97 cm.
The Marianne of Alice Laverty, was created after the serie of terrorist attacks that stroke France. Painting illustrating a thinking about what is the French Nation. Through a symbolist approach of the body, Alice Laverty questions the freedom of speech in a post-attacks country.
Alice Laverty' s Marianne is untying her mouth, her tongue, she rises from the splashes, and stares at you. Her face is covering two characters painted underneath, who challenge each other,a s two opponents. And the patterns of human biological tissue reminds the unifying and secular aspect of the symbol. The palette evokes without taboos the colors of the French flag.
Mixt technics on canvas, 130 x 97 cm. Frame in a white frame.
