Portrait of Niki de Saint Phalle, from the series "Les Palpitantes". Oil on canvas and mixed technique, 80x80cm. Visual artist who has staged the body of women in a monumental and imposing way.
  She will have played with her beauty, and therefore used her corporality to create and push her artistic career. Traumatized in her flesh during her childhood, she will create in a frenzy to stay alive. It is this very incarnate and violent relationship between her, her art, and the existence, which made it a perfect subject for Les Palpitantes. In this portrait, it is not so much a question of showing her beauty, but her fantasy and the escape that creation was for her.
