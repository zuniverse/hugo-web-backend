Apparition 1/2, oil on canvas of the diptych, 90x73 cm, white frame.
The diptyque Apparitions proposes a symbolist painting that questions our addiction to smartphones and new means of communication.
From one canvas to another, in this diptych, a smartphone earphone creeps realistically between the characters. Does the headphone wire connect us? Is it moving away from the present? Elder of Generation Y, the artist observes these prostheses hinder us as much as we free. She offers us in her painting a "state of fact" melancholy.
