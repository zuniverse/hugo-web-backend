The Art Fair of Feurs, on 8 July, celebrates 100 years of Nelson Mandela's birth. For this occasion, I realized "Apart-head", a witness of a state of fact in South Africa, referring to symbolic colours of the South African flag. The Indigenous, cut from himself but still there, whether we want him or not, rooted in his original land, re-emerged. More Hieratic than ever. Symbolist tribute to Mandela's fight.
Oil on Canvas,lacquered, 73 x 60, Framed in an ancient golden frame.
