Monad 2/2, oil on canvas, golden spray, 100 x81 cm.
Painting part of the theme of Alice Laverty on the relationship between the body and the new means of communication. A smartphone earphone, as on the works Apparitions, is immersed in the canvas through a hyper-realism that denotes the usual paw of the painter. The artist questions the relationship between our body and these tools.
