Transmission 2/3, 73x60 cm, oil on canvas, golden spray. Work on the organic aspect of our humanity, and the link of flesh between mother and child, where the cells connect two beings who are fatally separated, in the growth. Out of the couple, but in an equally intimate context, the stakes of individuality are replayed.
Private Collection.
