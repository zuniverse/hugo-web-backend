The call, Oil on canvas, lacquered, 100 x 70 cm.
Painting evoking addiction to the smartphone. The questioning of our relationship with NTIC'S is at the heart of many of Alice Laverty's paintings. The wires of the headphones hold us on a leash? We find ourselves prisoners of our impatience, painful to wait for the message, the call, the like, the sharing, the comment, which does not happen.
