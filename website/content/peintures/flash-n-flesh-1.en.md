Canvas 1/2 of the diptych Flash and Flesh. Oil on canvas, 91x73 cm.
Research work on the motif, inspired by medical imaging. These medical and scientific sources give the artist the graphic inspiration to work on the universal dimension of the human body. The body envelope embodying our individuality. How to gather on the canvas the stakes of the human condition locked in a mass of matter that separates us as much as it binds us to each other.
In this painting, the artist wants to turn away from certain canons of marketed beauty.
