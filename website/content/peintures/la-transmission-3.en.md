Transmission 3/3, 85x61 cm, oil on canvas, acrylic gold, lacquer. 3rd canvas of the series "Transmission", theme of "mother to child". A timeless theme that caught the artist in spite of herself. This third proposal was born from a photo of a friend of the artist and his son. The artist was touched by universal tenderness and peace. So, in this universe where images are used only to shock, Alice Laverty seeks a vibrant and forward-looking painting. Patterns of body tissue are always present, to remind us of our corporality, so questioned on the eve of transhumanism, but in his eyes, so miraculous.
