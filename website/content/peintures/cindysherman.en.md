Portrait of Cindy Sherman, from the series "The Throbbings". Oil on canvas and mixed technique, 80x80cm.
Cindy Sherman, photographer and woman artist having her place in my gallery of portrait of women artists, series "Les Palpitantes". Cindy Sherman stages herself, disguises herself, makes herself up, to be someone else the time of her shot. We look for her in her own self-portraits. Her body and face are her tools, she puts him to the test ... On photo paper.
