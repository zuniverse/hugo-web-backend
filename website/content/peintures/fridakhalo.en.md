Portrait of Frida Khalo, from the series "The Throbbings". Oil on canvas and mixed technique, 80x80cm.
Frida Khalo is probably one of the painters who will have suffered the most in her flesh. And his painting was only a way to survive. Passionate and thrilling woman, carried by her love for Diego Riveira, she suffered her love and physical passion until the end of the brush. She embodies the vital relationship between her own body and her own artistic creation, and how both feed and are inseparable. She will use the singularity of her figure as a signature.
