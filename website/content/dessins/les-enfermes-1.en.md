Locked up 1, Autoportrait, Bic pen autoportrait, 50x70 cm.
The artist illustrates her reflection on our addiction to NTI'C, and the formatting that ubiquitous screens operate on our field of vision, without our even being aware of it. What if our faces were crushed behind the screen? And if we lock ourselves into a graphic virtuality? And our children, having their profile already put online by the parents, even before having their first tooth?
Ironic artistic work on our contemporary addictions.
The Bic pen allows to highlight a certain attachment of the artist to the technique.
